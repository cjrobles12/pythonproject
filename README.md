Final Project for Code Louisville Python Fall 2017

PinScene is an app designed to let users create a guide to pinball machines in their city. This is the first part of what could become fuller social network style app for pinball enthusiasts. Anyone viewing the webpage can see a list of pinball machines in town, and if they click on the link more information is available. Once logged in a user can create new listings and edit some of the associated fields. Logged in users are also able to delete pinball machines.

New users should start by clicking the register link and creating an account. Then click on the pins link to start creating and editing pinball machines.
